   <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
      On Halloween night, Emily and her friends decided to explore the old house at the end of their street. It had been abandoned for years, with peeling paint, broken windows, and a creaky gate that squeaked whenever the wind blew. Everyone in the neighborhood knew spooky tales about it—strange sounds and mysterious shadows seen from afar. Emily, the bravest of the group, led them with a flashlight, determined to discover if the house was haunted. As they pushed open the heavy front door, a gust of chilly air whooshed past them, making them shiver.
      
      Inside, the house was dark, silent, and full of eerie shadows that stretched across the walls. Cobwebs clung to every corner, and the old wooden floors creaked with every step. They tiptoed from room to room, each one holding their breath, as if even the slightest sound might wake the ghosts of the past. Just when they started to relax, they heard a loud thud coming from upstairs. Heartbeats quickening, they looked at each other, wide-eyed. Emily decided they should investigate, though her friends were unsure. Holding hands for courage, they made their way up the dusty staircase, each step creaking underfoot.
      
      When they reached the top, they found an old trunk in the corner of the attic. Curiosity overcame their fear, and they slowly opened it, only to find costumes, old-fashioned Halloween masks, and even a handwritten note that read, “Happy Halloween to the brave ones who enter!” They laughed, realizing that the house wasn’t haunted but simply full of forgotten memories and spooky legends. Feeling relieved, they headed back outside, happy they had faced their fears—and with a new story to tell.</p>
